# VirtualKeyboard

I created a keyboard on the screen using OpenCV and mediapipe.

When the index and middle fingers are attached on the button, a clicking action is performed. The clicked characters will be displayed in the box below.

When you want to use this file, please type the following

```
git clone https://github.com/hibiki0612/VirtualKeyboard.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
